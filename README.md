# 📊 Business Social Network Analysis with Gephi

This repository contains **social network analysis** projects applied to business datasets using **Gephi**.  
It includes two main research questions:

- **Q2:** Identify products that are commonly purchased together in an e-commerce dataset.
- **Q16:** Identify product features that most influence car purchase decisions in a car sales dataset.

Both analyses involve **data preprocessing**, **network construction**, **visualization**, and **interpretation** of findings.
