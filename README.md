# üìä Business Social Network Analysis with Gephi

> Network analysis of product co-purchases (**Q2**) and feature influence on buying decisions (**Q16**) using **Gephi**, based on e-commerce and car sales datasets.

---

## üìñ Project Overview

This repository contains **social network analysis** projects applied to real-world business datasets using **Gephi**.  
It focuses on two key questions:

- **Q2:** Which products are commonly purchased together in an e-commerce dataset?  
- **Q16:** Which product features most influence car purchase decisions in a car sales dataset?  

Both analyses involve:

- **Data preprocessing**  
- **Network construction**  
- **Visualization**  
- **Interpretation of results**
